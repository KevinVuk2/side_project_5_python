This project performs an exploratory data analysis on Google Trends data for various workout-related keywords. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and shifts in fitness interests over time and across different geographical regions, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Analysis Overview

The notebook uses pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to manipulate and visualize data from several CSV files to answer four main questions:


1. When did worldwide interest in "workout" peak?
The notebook analyzes temporal data to pinpoint the exact month when the search term "workout" reached its peak popularity worldwide, corresponding to an index value of 100.


2. How have workout preferences changed over time?
By plotting the search trends for "home workout," "gym workout," and "home gym," the analysis illustrates the evolution of fitness habits. It highlights a significant spike in "home workout" searches during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the prevailing trend in workout types today.


3. Which country is most interested in "workout"?
The analysis examines geographical data from 2018 to 2023 to compare search interest for the general term "workout" across major countries, identifying which nation had the highest search volume during this period.


4. Which country has the highest interest in "home workouts"?
Focusing on regional preferences, the project uses bar charts to compare the popularity of "home workout," "gym workout," and "home gym" in different countries, determining the top country for at-home fitness interest.
